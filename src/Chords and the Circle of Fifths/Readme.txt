How to use (aq) Chord pack.

This (aq) Pack has a collection of tools that I use in helping me create and compose music.  It is a collection of Drag and Drop Chords as well as a color code for ableton live clips.

The Circle of Fifths:

In this file you will see an image called "circle_sm". This is the circle of fifths with one unique feture. All the colors of the different positions on the circle are color coded for the ableton live color code.

Basicly so when you color all your songs using the colors in the image, depending on key, then you can really easily do harminic mixing. Simple rule is you can go one position to the left or right or up or down the two rings on position. This will make the sounds fit really well togeather.

The Drag and Drop Files:

There is also a file called "chords" this file contains a set of chords by major and Minor. YOu can go through and pick chords by the key you are in. When you are in ableton you can seach in the library brouser for this file and then just drag and drop in your session. The clips are already set to match the image of the circle of fifths.

The files also contain straight MIDI if you want to use it in other DAW's.

Ableton Set:

There is also an ableton live set where I lay out all the chords by the Major, Minor, Key, and so on.

How I use this:

I use the chord files as drag and drop in my session. Sence they are already made and I can easily make a harmony it saves me a lot of time.  Lets say I am in C. I go to the "chords" folder, then to "Major" then to "c major key" I drag a few in and arrage them. Supper simple and savesme time of recording them or writing them by hand.
